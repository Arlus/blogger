-This is an upgraded version of my-blogger.

-Improvements included are:
	-RSS feeds
	-Archives
	-Newsletter subscriptions & unsubscriptions
	-Related posts based on post meta tags
	
-Newsletters are handled by MailChimp and so you have to create an account, create a list then replace the MailChimp newsletter subscription form code with the one it will generate from your settings. The same goes with the newsletter unsubscription link.
